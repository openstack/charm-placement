# Overview

This is a "source" charm, which is intended to be strictly the top
layer of a built charm.  This structure declares that any included
layer assets are not intended to be consumed as a layer from a
functional or design standpoint.

# Test and Build

Building, pushing and publishing to the charm store is automated
by CI to ensure consistent flow.  Manually building is useful for
development and testing, however.

```
tox -e pep8
tox -e py37
tox -e build
```
